Validator Application - AtomOne

## Validator Directory: Michael Frasinelli / Frasinelli Systems

1) The name of your validator

- FrasinelliSystems

2) Why you want to become a validator for GovNo and AtomOne

I strongly believe in the importance of security above all else on the hub, providing a stable foundation for endless chains and projects to build on top of it. Everything in my economic and quantitative background points towards the separation of monetary aspects and governance/staking aspects being a core element of long term sustainability. 

3) Brief history/ Intro to your validator

I have not run validator nodes since 2021, largely turning my focus towards development and building within the Polkadot, EVM, Stacks/Bitcoin, and now Cosmos ecosystems as a tokenomics/quant lead. I previously ran validator nodes for Polygon, FLUX, and dozens for Presearch. I still actively run L7 Litecoin miners which are set up to maximize profit through the mining of whatever compatible coin is most profitable at the time, before ultimately converting it back into LTC.

I would like to use this GovGen node as a learning opportunity and refresher in terms of running validators, allowing me time to build back up a series of local validator networks with backup node systems. I have a long background in quantitative research, data science, and economics/game theory that I would love to once again apply to this sector of the industry. I believe the aspect of decentralized infrastructure is one of the most fascinating and important aspects of blockchain as a whole.

Validator: govgenvaloper12q22l5jygac2zpvhxhrn9t64wdhkkdxeqpjc5s
Delegate: govgen12q22l5jygac2zpvhxhrn9t64wdhkkdxe3rme72

8) Must replicate, understand, and validate the genesis distribution. (See https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/pull/65#pullrequestreview-1775992431)

  - In process, will be completed this weekend

9) Must contribute to the above to prove understanding of it by contributing to the code or creating a PR/PRs

  - See GovGen and AtomOne distribution conversations under multiple GitHub issues. Built a full AtomOne distribution analysis dashboard to assist in that eventual community decision (multiplier amounts, % that each proposal impacts weighting, etc).

10) Must adhere to a global decentralization mandate and if required to cooperate in translation for an efficient global reach

  - Decentralization is one of the main values of CrowdControl. We adhere to it. Furthermore we are capable of writing [high quality articles](https://medium.com/coinmonks/the-ultimate-cosmos-delegation-guide-for-real-idiots-87ebc6518145) for an efficient global reach

11) Must provide Transparency disclosures of associations among validators. (Also see [Validators and KYC #75](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094)).

  - Working with AiB employees, but as an AtomOne contributor with my role being under New Tendermint leading the separate Gnoland tokenomic/quantitative efforts.

12) The Community will put together best practices for KYC-ing and approving validator submissions. The conversation can be followed here: ([Validators and KYC #75)](https://github.com/atomone-hub/genesis/issues/75#issue-2034573094))

I am more than happy to participate in any future KYC requirements beyond this initial application.
